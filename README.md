# LandingPage-top-
The Odin Project "Landing Page-project" 
In this excersice I will try and build a landing page based on a picture given to me by the Odin Project. It will be focus on using flex correctly. I will do my own version based on "facial expressons", just so I have something to work with. I am thinking to use nano-banana or similar to create pictures for this.
